# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is a quality that not only tracks changes to the code, but also allows devs to go back to previous versions to fix problems that might result. It is useful both because it makes working with other devs much easier and because it facillitates trouble shooting. 
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a copy split off of the main source that allows many coders to work on the code and then later merge the code together to have a finished product.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a statement made after a change to the code that summerizes in great detail the change that was made. It creates a save point that you can use to fix code issues.
* What merge conflict? A merge conflict occurs when a coder tries to merge two files that have two conflicting lines of code. This can happen if two different coders edit the same line of code, or if someone deletes a file someone else edited.
